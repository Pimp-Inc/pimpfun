## 📊 Code Organization

### Modular Architecture
The codebase has been refactored from a monolithic structure to organized modules:

#### Before (Monolithic)
- ❌ 11,634 lines in single HTML file
- ❌ Mixed concerns (UI, logic, data)
- ❌ No testing infrastructure
- ❌ Difficult to maintain

#### After (Modular)
- ✅ Separated concerns in dedicated modules
- ✅ Comprehensive unit test coverage
- ✅ Clear API documentation
- ✅ Easy to extend and maintain

### Key Modules

#### StoreSystem.js
Handles all store-related functionality:
- Quantity adjustments and validation
- Purchase processing and cost calculation
- Bulk deal savings computation
- UI display updates

#### GameStateManager.js
Manages game state and persistence:
- State initialization and validation
- Net worth calculations
- Turn regeneration system
- Statistics tracking
- Data migration between versions

## 🎨 Game Systems

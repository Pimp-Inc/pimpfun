## 🔧 **KNOWN BUGS TO FIX:**

### **HIGH PRIORITY:**

1. **🏙️ District Selection Broken**
   ```javascript
   // Issue: selectDistrict() modal not appearing
   // Fix needed: Check DISTRICTS object, modal rendering
   ```

2. **🔄 Refresh Data Loss (Still Happening?)**
   ```javascript
   // Issue: Resources disappearing after refresh
   // Fix needed: Verify save/load cycle in authenticated mode
   ```

3. **🎯 Hood Pimp Spawning**
   ```javascript
   // Issue: May not spawn automatically for new users

   ```

   ```javascript
   // Issue: Some modals may still be too long on mobile
   // Fix needed: Test all modals on small screens
   ```

5. **🧮 Math Verification Needed**
   ```javascript
   // Issue: Combat loot percentages, scout yields need verification
   // Fix needed: Audit all formulas match specifications
   ```

6. **⚙️ Function Inconsistencies**

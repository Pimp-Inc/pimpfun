# 🎩 PIMP.FUN — Final Leveling & Ranking System
### *"From Broke to Meme Lord — 69 Levels of Digital Debauchery"*

---

## Executive Summary

**Game Structure**: 30-day competitive seasons with full reset
**Max Level**: 69 (MEME LORD at $69.4 BILLION)
**Progression**: Exponential growth through net worth, respect, and influence
**Your Current Status**: Level 13 ($1.9M net worth) - On track for mid-tier finish

---

## ⚖️ Design Philosophy

The PIMP.Fun leveling system is not just a number grind. It's an **empire fantasy loop**.
Players rise from the gutter to global power through exponential wealth, social status, and strategic control.

Progression is based on three intertwined forces:

1. **Net Worth Growth (Wealth)** — classic money + asset value
2. **Respect (Reputation)** — earned in PvP, crew battles, and achievements
3. **Influence (Control)** — territories, NFTs, and crew bonuses that multiply gains

Each tier introduces **new mechanics, systems, and flex potential** — reflecting a real-world climb through organized chaos.

The pacing curve follows the **420/69 exponential model**:
- Each major tier increases wealth targets **10× over the previous**
- Each level within a tier scales **~1.4×–2×**
- This structure rewards daily play, long-term ambition, and a 30-day competitive season reset cycle

---

## 💡 Core Progression Pillars

| Progress Source | Weight | Description |
|----------------|--------|-------------|
| 💰 **Net Worth Growth** | 60% | Your hoes, thugs, territories, and assets create exponential XP |
| 💀 **Respect & PvP Wins** | 25% | Every battle, theft, or defense adds Respect XP — the true street currency |
| 💎 **Achievements & NFTs** | 15% | Seasonal NFTs, special events, and milestones amplify your XP curve |

### Level-Up Multiplier
Each level achieved increases total passive income by **+0.69%**, stacking indefinitely.
At Level 69, this equates to a **+47.6% total income multiplier** before NFT and territory boosts.

---

## 🔁 Season & Reset Loop

**Seasons last 30 days.**
At the end, everything resets (cash, hoes, thugs, etc.), except:

- **NFTs** (permanent bonuses)
- **Respect** (soft reset; 30% carryover)
- **Achievements** (tracked lifetime)

**Top players** each season immortalized in the **Hall of Pimps**.
**Meme Lord Ascension:** Level 69 players gain "Prestige Power" and start the next season with permanent multipliers.

---

## 🎮 The Emotional Arc

**Levels 1–9:** Fast dopamine hits - constant progression
**Levels 10–24:** Strategic investment and discovery
**Levels 25–39:** Identity and status - you're somebody now
**Levels 40–54:** Power and politics - alliances matter
**Levels 55–69:** Chaos and godhood - legendary warfare

By design, **every phase feels like a new game**, not a longer grind.

## Hybrid Level Formula

### The Calculation
```javascript
function calculatePlayerLevel() {
    const netWorth = calculateNetWorth();

    // 70% from net worth
    let baseLevel = getBaseLevelFromNetWorth(netWorth);

    // 20% from respect
    const respectBonus = getRespectBonus(gameState.player.respect);

    // 10% from achievements
    const achievementBonus = getAchievementBonus();

    // Final level (capped at 69)
    return Math.min(baseLevel + respectBonus + achievementBonus, 69);
}
```

### Respect Bonus System
```javascript
function getRespectBonus(respect) {
    if (respect >= 10000) return 6;  // Legendary status
    if (respect >= 5000) return 5;   // Elite
    if (respect >= 3500) return 4;   // High
    if (respect >= 2500) return 3;   // Strong
    if (respect >= 1500) return 2;   // Moderate
    if (respect >= 1000) return 1;   // Growing
    if (respect >= 500) return 1;    // Basic
    return 0;
}
```

**How to Gain Respect:**
- Defeat NPCs: +5-50 respect per win
- Win PvP battles: +10-500 respect (based on opponent level)
- Control territories: +10-100 respect/day
- Complete achievements: +50-1000 respect
- Defeat kingpin NPCs: +100-500 respect

### Achievement Bonus System
```javascript
function getAchievementBonus() {
    let bonus = 0;

    // Combat achievements
    const npcsDefeated = gameState.player.npcsDefeated || 0;
    if (npcsDefeated >= 500) bonus += 3;
    else if (npcsDefeated >= 250) bonus += 2;
    else if (npcsDefeated >= 100) bonus += 1;
    else if (npcsDefeated >= 50) bonus += 1;

    // Empire size
    const hoes = gameState.resources.hoes || 0;
    if (hoes >= 1000) bonus += 3;
    else if (hoes >= 500) bonus += 2;
    else if (hoes >= 300) bonus += 1;
    else if (hoes >= 100) bonus += 1;

    // Arsenal
    const totalWeapons = Object.values(gameState.resources.weapons || {})
        .reduce((sum, count) => sum + count, 0);
    if (totalWeapons >= 500) bonus += 3;
    else if (totalWeapons >= 300) bonus += 2;
    else if (totalWeapons >= 150) bonus += 1;
    else if (totalWeapons >= 100) bonus += 1;

    // Vehicle fleet
    const totalVehicles = Object.values(gameState.resources.vehicles || {})
        .reduce((sum, count) => sum + count, 0);
    if (totalVehicles >= 100) bonus += 3;
    else if (totalVehicles >= 50) bonus += 2;
    else if (totalVehicles >= 25) bonus += 1;
    else if (totalVehicles >= 10) bonus += 1;

    // Kingpin slayer
    const kingpinsDefeated = gameState.player.kingpinsDefeated || 0;
    if (kingpinsDefeated >= 20) bonus += 4;
    else if (kingpinsDefeated >= 10) bonus += 3;
    else if (kingpinsDefeated >= 5) bonus += 2;
    else if (kingpinsDefeated >= 1) bonus += 1;

    // Territory control
    const territoriesOwned = gameState.player.territoriesOwned || 0;
    if (territoriesOwned >= 10) bonus += 3;
    else if (territoriesOwned >= 5) bonus += 2;
    else if (territoriesOwned >= 3) bonus += 1;

    // PvP victories
    const pvpWins = gameState.player.pvpWins || 0;
    if (pvpWins >= 100) bonus += 4;
    else if (pvpWins >= 50) bonus += 3;
    else if (pvpWins >= 25) bonus += 2;
    else if (pvpWins >= 10) bonus += 1;

    return Math.min(bonus, 10); // Cap at +10 levels from achievements
}
```

## PvP Wealth Transfer Mechanics

### Steal Percentage Formula
```javascript
function calculateStealAmount(attackerLevel, defenderLevel, defenderNetWorth) {
    let baseSteal = 0.10; // 10% base

    // Level difference bonus
    const levelDiff = attackerLevel - defenderLevel;
    if (levelDiff >= 10) baseSteal += 0.10; // +10% if 10+ levels higher
    else if (levelDiff >= 5) baseSteal += 0.05; // +5% if 5+ levels higher
    else if (levelDiff <= -10) baseSteal -= 0.05; // -5% if 10+ levels lower

    // Victory margin bonus (based on thug stats)
    // Calculated in battle system
    const victoryBonus = 0.00; // 0-10% based on crushing victory

    // Total steal percentage
    const totalSteal = Math.min(baseSteal + victoryBonus, 0.30); // Cap at 30%

    return defenderNetWorth * totalSteal;
}
```

### Protection Mechanics
```javascript
function calculateProtectedWealth(netWorth, defenseNFTs, territories) {
    let protectionRate = 0.50; // 50% of wealth is protected base

    // NFT protection bonuses
    protectionRate += defenseNFTs * 0.05; // +5% per defensive NFT

    // Territory protection
    protectionRate += territories * 0.02; // +2% per territory owned

    // Cap at 80% protected
    protectionRate = Math.min(protectionRate, 0.80);

    return netWorth * protectionRate;
}
```

### Attack Cooldowns
- **Same player**: 1 hour cooldown
- **Any player**: 5 minute global cooldown
- **After losing**: 15 minute protection period

### Revenge System
- **Revenge attack within 1 hour**: No cooldown
- **Revenge steal bonus**: +5% steal amount
- **Revenge respect bonus**: Double respect gain

## Territory Control System

### Territory Income (Per Day)

#### Small Territories (15 per district)
- **Income**: $10K-$50K per day (Level 1-10 players)
- **Income**: $100K-$500K per day (Level 11-25 players)
- **Income**: $1M-$5M per day (Level 26-40 players)
- **Control requirement**: Defeat territory boss NPC

#### Large Territories (3 per district)
- **Income**: $500K-$2M per day (Level 15-25 players)
- **Income**: $5M-$20M per day (Level 26-40 players)
- **Income**: $50M-$200M per day (Level 41-55 players)
- **Control requirement**: Defeat district boss NPC + hold for 24 hours

#### Full District Control (1 per district)
- **Income**: $5M-$20M per day (Level 20-30 players)
- **Income**: $50M-$200M per day (Level 31-45 players)
- **Income**: $500M-$1B per day (Level 46-60 players)
- **Income**: $5B-$10B per day (Level 61-69 players)
- **Control requirement**: Own all territories + defeat all district NPCs

### Territory Contests
- **Challenge existing owner**: PvP battle
- **Winner takes territory**: Instant ownership transfer
- **Loser gets 1-hour immunity**: Can't be challenged again immediately

---

## Balance Considerations

### Early Game (Levels 1-15)
**Progression Speed**: Fast (1-2 levels per day)
**Main Activities**:
- NPC grinding (80% of wealth)
- Small PvP (15% of wealth)
- Territory control (5% of wealth)

**Balance Goal**: Let players learn mechanics without being crushed by whales

### Mid Game (Levels 16-35)
**Progression Speed**: Moderate (1 level per day)
**Main Activities**:
- NPC grinding (40% of wealth)
- Medium PvP (40% of wealth)
- Territory control (20% of wealth)

**Balance Goal**: Skill matters more than NFTs, but NFTs give edge

### Late Game (Levels 36-55)
**Progression Speed**: Slow (1 level per 2 days)
**Main Activities**:
- Large PvP (60% of wealth)
- Territory wars (30% of wealth)
- NPC farming (10% of wealth)

**Balance Goal**: PvP becomes primary driver, alliances critical

### End Game (Levels 56-69)
**Progression Speed**: Very slow (1 level per 3-4 days)
**Main Activities**:
- Epic PvP battles (80% of wealth)
- Full district control (15% of wealth)
- Alliance warfare (5% of wealth - team wealth transfers)

**Balance Goal**: Only the elite compete here, requires perfect execution

## Summary & Next Steps

### What We've Designed
✅ **69-level exponential system** ($69 → $69.4B)
✅ **30-day season structure** with PvP focus
✅ **NFT bonus system** with stacking & synergy
✅ **Power-up system** for temporary boosts
✅ **Territory control** for passive income
✅ **PvP wealth transfers** with protection mechanics
✅ **Complete formula** with respect + achievements
✅ **Anti-cheat measures** and fair play rules

### Your Current Status
- **Level 13** (should be, currently shows 4)
- **Rare thug access** (can hire now)
- **On track** for Epic by Day 10, Legendary by Day 15
- **Competitive** for top 500 finish at current pace

### Implementation Priority
1. **Update level calculation** (remove XP, add net worth formula)
2. **Add thug tier unlocks** (5, 10, 15, 25, 40, 55)
3. **Test progression curve** (simulate 30-day season)
4. **Balance NFT bonuses** (ensure whales don't dominate too hard)
5. **Implement PvP steal mechanics** (10-30% with protections)
6. **Add territory income** (passive wealth generation)
7. **Create season reset system** (30-day cycles)

### Questions for Balance Testing
1. **Is $69.4B too high for max level?** (1-3 players per season should reach it)
2. **Are NFT bonuses too strong?** (Whales with 6+ NFTs start at Level 20+)
3. **Is PvP steal % fair?** (10-30% steal, 50-80% protected)
4. **Should respect bonuses be higher?** (Currently max +6 levels)
5. **Are territory incomes balanced?** ($10K/day early, $10B/day late)

## 👑 Prestige System

### What is Prestige?
**Prestige** is unlocked by reaching **Level 69 (Meme Lord)**. It allows you to **reset your empire** for permanent power boosts.

### How Prestige Works
1. **Reach Level 69** during a season
2. **Choose to Prestige** (optional, can stay at 69)
3. **Reset to Level 1** (fresh start)
4. **Keep**:
   - All NFTs
   - 30% of respect
   - All achievements
5. **Gain**:
   - **+10% base income** (permanent, stacks with NFTs)
   - **Prestige badge** (cosmetic, shows your status)
   - **Exclusive Prestige NFTs** (only available to Meme Lords)
   - **Title prefix**: "Meme Lord" (e.g., "Meme Lord PiMpToShi")

### Prestige Levels
Each time you reach Level 69 again, you gain another Prestige level:

| Prestige | Title | Base Income Bonus | Special Perks |
|----------|-------|-------------------|---------------|
| 0 | (None) | 0% | Normal player |
| 1 | Meme Lord | +10% | Prestige badge, exclusive NFTs |
| 2 | Meme Lord II | +20% | Double prestige aura |
| 3 | Meme Lord III | +30% | Triple prestige aura, legendary cosmetics |
| 4 | Meme Lord IV | +40% | Quadruple prestige aura |
| 5+ | Meme Lord V+ | +50%+ | Ultimate flex, god-tier status |

### Prestige Bonuses Stack Forever
```javascript
// Example: Prestige 3 player
baseIncome = 100000; // $100K/day from hoes
prestigeMultiplier = 1.30; // +30% from Prestige 3
nftMultiplier = 1.95; // +95% from 6 NFTs
totalIncome = baseIncome * prestigeMultiplier * nftMultiplier;
// = $100K * 1.30 * 1.95 = $253,500/day
```

### Prestige Strategy
**Should you prestige immediately?**
- **Yes, if**: You want permanent power boost and have time to grind again
- **No, if**: Season ends soon and you want to compete for top spot
- **Maybe, if**: You're testing builds and want to experiment

**Optimal strategy**: Reach Level 69 early in a season (Day 15-20), prestige immediately, grind back to 69 for **double Meme Lord status** in one season.

## 🌙 Hustle XP (Offline Progression)

### What is Hustle XP?
**Hustle XP** allows you to earn progress while **offline** (up to 6 hours).

### How It Works:
```javascript
function calculateOfflineHustleXP() {
    const hoursOffline = (Date.now() - lastOnlineTime) / 3600000;
    const cappedHours = Math.min(hoursOffline, 6); // Max 6 hours

    // Calculate offline earnings
    const hoeIncome = gameState.resources.hoes * 20 * cappedHours; // $20/hoe/hour
    const territoryIncome = getTerritoryIncome() * cappedHours;

    // Apply offline income
    gameState.player.cash += hoeIncome + territoryIncome;

    // Update level
    updatePlayerLevel();
}
```

### Hustle XP Rates:
- **Hoes**: $20/hour per hoe (vs $100/hour when active)
- **Territories**: Full passive rate
- **Thugs**: No cost while offline
- **Max cap**: 6 hours (prevents exploitation)

### Example:
- **100 hoes** + **2 territories** ($100K/day each)
- **6 hours offline**:
  - Hoe income: 100 × $20 × 6 = $12,000
  - Territory income: $200K/day ÷ 4 = $50,000
  - **Total**: $62,000 earned while sleeping

### Why 6-Hour Cap?
- **Fair for casual players** (can't play 24/7)
- **Prevents AFKing** (can't just leave game running)
- **Encourages daily logins** (check in twice/day to maximize)

## 🎯 Ready to Implement or Needs Adjustment?

### What We've Designed
✅ **Complete 69-level progression** with emotional arc
✅ **8 tiers** from Rookie to Meme Lord
✅ **Respect system** as secondary XP track
✅ **Prestige system** for infinite replayability
✅ **Crew & Alliance ranking** for social gameplay
✅ **Hustle XP** for offline progression
✅ **Level-up rewards** with milestone bonuses
✅ **JSON schemas** ready for dev import

### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Import `levels_min.json` and `constants.json` into codebase
- [ ] Update level calculation to use new formula
- [ ] Add respect tracking and bonuses
- [ ] Implement tier unlock system
- [ ] Create prestige system
- [ ] Add crew/alliance features
- [ ] Implement offline Hustle XP
- [ ] Test progression curve across 30-day simulation

### Balance Questions
1. **Are net worth targets achievable in 30 days?** (With PvP, should be)
2. **Is respect carryover (30%) fair?** (Gives vets edge without dominance)
3. **Are prestige bonuses too strong?** (+10% per prestige might compound fast)
4. **Should Hustle XP cap be 6 hours or 8?** (Balance casual vs hardcore)
5. **Are NFT bonuses balanced?** (6 NFTs = +300-500% income)

**Let me know if you want to:**
- Adjust any net worth targets
- Tweak respect/achievement weights
- Modify prestige bonuses
- Add more unlock features
- Create additional JSON schemas

**Ready to code this into the game!**

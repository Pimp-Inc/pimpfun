## 📊 **IMPACT ON GAMEPLAY:**

### **🎮 Current Experience:**
*"I have 6 thugs. They make crack and fight sometimes."*

### **🎪 Enhanced Experience:**
*"Ice Cold Tony (my hothead enforcer) is feuding with Smooth Mike (my professional dealer) because Tony called him 'Spreadsheet Papi' during the last crew meeting. Meanwhile, Diamond Dave Wright (my zen scout and mentor to both) is ready for underboss promotion but there are only 2 slots available citywide. I need to decide whether to risk the 3% promotion chance or wait for a better opportunity. Also, Tony wants to handle some 'family business' at the Harbor Docks - apparently someone disrespected his sister. Do I approve his personal mission for +loyalty but risk +heat, or keep him focused on crew operations?"*
